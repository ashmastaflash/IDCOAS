Infectious Disease Correlation and Outbreak Alerting System

Project goals:
+ Consume sample data into AlienVault OSSIM (create custom plugin)
+ Create correlation rules to alert based on frequency of certain types of pathogens
+ Either use OTX threat map or create simple heatmap from information in OSSIM's DB
+ Use OpenGraphiti to visualize information (will require special export script to feed into OpenGraphiti's format)
+ Create an outbreak simulator to generate detection events for feding into OSSIM
