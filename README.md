Infectious Disease Correlation and Outbreak Alerting System

Project goals:
  1) Consume sample data into AlienVault OSSIM (create custom plugin)
  2) Create correlation rules to alert based on frequency of certain types of pathogens
  3) Either use OTX threat map or create simple heatmap from information in OSSIM's DB
  4) Use OpenGraphiti to visualize information (will require special export script to feed into OpenGraphiti's format)
  5) Create an outbreak simulator to generate detection events for feding into OSSIM
